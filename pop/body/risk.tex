\chapter{Risk Consideration}
\label{ch:risk}
The research part of this project does not contain potential risks, however, similar to other engineering projects, accidents could happen on the project management level. To avoid accidents and ensure the project progresses smoothly, periodically reviewing on the whole project is required. Measures include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Periodically backing up project files in case of physical damage on devices. 
    \item Consulting with supervisor immediately once emergency issue happens.
    \item Encrypting project files in case of unauthorized access.
\end{enumerate}
