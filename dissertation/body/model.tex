\chapter{Semi-Shape-Preserved Clustering Representation}
This chapter introduces our proposed novel representation method that are temporarily named as Semi-Shape-Preserved Clustering Representation (SSPCR) and how we design it according to the guideline of the project. ``Semi-Shape-Preserved'' means that the generated feature vector contains the shape information of the original sequence while does not explicitly approximate it. ``Clustering'' means that this method is designed for clustering tasks.
